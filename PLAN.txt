now:

future:
- waveform selection (what gets played)
- small waveforms in the sequencer
- thickish handles for very short samples
- SoundBuffer is unnecessary: QVector<float> would be enough (and WtsAudio::BufferAt would become SoundBuffer and SoundBuffer's can share data vectors)
  (but: need to remember buffer names somewhere)
- more playback feedback
  - mark / animate active samples in sequencer timeline
  - display current output in the waveform (but where do I mix then?)
