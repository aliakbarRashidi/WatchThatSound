now:

- delete
    - show currently selected thing in one widget
    - when mouseover a currently selected thing - add [X] for deletion
    and <-- --> to move framewise
    - to properly delete we need to remember whose is selection now
    (make wts widgets participate in qt focus). On the other hand
    focusable widgets depend on current screen. Think further.

future:
- framewise motion (including motion with current selection)
- waveform selection (what gets played)
- small waveforms in the sequencer
- handles for very short samples
- more playback feedback
  - mark / animate active samples in sequencer timeline
  - display current output in the waveform (but where do I mix then?)
- recording: countdown, stop when reached a scene boundary
- disable some actions in some states

- curve editing: use story board thumbnails to drag the curve
    - distinguish pinned thumbs and hanging, curve is defined by the pinned ones,
    the hanging just hang on it
    - how to unpin?
    - default line: scene markers = 0, last event = pin to 1.0
    - how to keep this up to date? remember which pins/unpins are added by whom

screens:
    - bioscoop: only the movie, stop (space bar) -> next screen
    - storyboard: storyboard in marker add mode and movie
    - curve: storyboard in curve editing mode and movie
    - score: storyboard in nav mode, score(edit), movie
    - recording: storyboard(nav), score(nav), sequence(edit), movie

    later:
    - rec studio with sound bank
    - effects
