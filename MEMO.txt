assumed dependency(-ies):
- Qt (LGPL v2.1 or GPL v3)

dependencies in 'Shoulders' (of giants) subdir:

- PortAudio (MIT, GPL compatible), daily snapshot (see directory name)
(statically linked, does this break any licensing terms?)

- FFmpeg (GPL/LGPL both v2 and v3), the FFmpeg team's git repository
configuration:
./configure \
--disable-doc \
--disable-ffmpeg \
--disable-ffplay \
--disable-ffprobe \
--disable-ffserver \
--disable-avdevice \
--disable-avfilter \
--disable-network

(without licensing switches it is LGPL v2)

When building on Windows, had to add c:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin to the end of PATH and only then build it (need sed, diff, mv etc). After having changed PATH had to rerun qmake.

portaudio:
./configure --disable-shared --enable-static
# the above breaks at the very end (doing chmod) but we can continue manually:
./config.status
# again, chmod complains, but we don't care
make

ffmpeg:

# without resctricting the PATH it was picking up some cygwin executable and failed to configure
# there is no yasm in (my) msys, disable it as well
PATH=/bin:/mingw/bin ./configure \
--disable-doc \
--disable-ffmpeg \
--disable-ffplay \
--disable-ffprobe \
--disable-ffserver \
--disable-avdevice \
--disable-avfilter \
--disable-network \
--disable-yasm

make
