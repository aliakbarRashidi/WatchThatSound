the latest news is below...

[ ] button bar:
    - make it a common timeline functionality (but with changeable button selection)
    - buttons emit some actions that affect data item corresponding to selection

    - button bar look: check out styles (want a flat translucent style)
    - positioning: center-under or something + be clever at window sides
    - can it go above the foreground?
        - make storyboard ticks part of its background instead
    - interaction: how can I make sure clicking in pane disables seek etc?
        - done for now, this will be even more logical when popups will move to TimeLineWidget

    - should be available for any item
    - should emit some actions...
    - start in the storyboard and work our way further
    - show currently selected thing in one widget
    - show extra panel like:
        [x] for deletion
        [<] [>] to move framewise

future:
- framewise motion (including motion with current selection)
- waveform selection (what gets played)
- small waveforms in the sequencer
- handles for very short samples
- more playback feedback
  - mark / animate active samples in sequencer timeline
  - display current output in the waveform (but where do I mix then?)
- recording: countdown, stop when reached a scene boundary
- disable some actions in some states

- curve editing: use story board thumbnails to drag the curve
    - distinguish pinned thumbs and hanging, curve is defined by the pinned ones,
    the hanging just hang on it
    - how to unpin?
    - default line: scene markers = 0, last event = pin to 1.0
    - how to keep this up to date? remember which pins/unpins are added by whom

screens:
    - bioscoop: only the movie, stop (space bar) -> next screen
    - storyboard: storyboard in marker add mode and movie
    - curve: storyboard in curve editing mode and movie
    - score: storyboard in nav mode, score(edit), movie
    - recording: storyboard(nav), score(nav), sequence(edit), movie

    later:
    - rec studio with sound bank
    - effects

* * *

now:

- export:
[x] export gui
[x] ffmpeg based export implementation

notes

need to be able to copy raw packets from m_videoFile.
this means there will be no video encoder, but a "copier".
there is something called "stream_copy" in AVStream, but not sure how to use it.
this also means that the stream parameters should be copied.

[x] add method to ask video codec from VideoFile.
[x] copy the rest of the video stream format over.
[x] give exporter access to the mixer api

* * *

[x] review the WtsAudio, there are two nearly identical methods, the common functionality should be moved into its own (template) method.
  [x] make a 'mix' function that works on floats
  [x] mix that fills int16 converts the result of the previous
  [x] higher level functions (sampler*) use the lower level mix ones

[x] review the exporter: what can go away, what can be improved for better maintainance?
[x] GUI: disable most buttons while exporting
    this is what modal QProgressDialog is for. let's see if it works for us.

* * *

[x] precompiled headers

* * *

[.] Factor out SoundBuffer, use QVector<float> instead. Questions:
    - name: the project maintains a mapping from sound vectors to names and back
    - sharing: BufferAt or Synced may refer to the same data
    - save/load: originals get saved once and are refered to by names

* * *

tabs:
1. movie selector (in stead of "browse...")
2. first play (just a movie)
3. story board editing
- movie
- story board in edit mode
4. recording
(current)

can use QState for state transitions.

each state (at least inside workshop) should have a map of:
- widget, mode

but this can be modelled by connections... except connections allow show/hiding, not more...

[x] use restore policy and set the shown property on uis...
[x] some way to add buttons for triggering states
    (hard code for now)

* * *

movie selector:

[x] upon startup - create a container with a button group, each button corresponds to a found movie
[x] upon movie selection transite into "first play"

* * *

score (partituur)
[x] save score
[x] load score

[x] correct length:
1. store in scene coords
2. when updating the graphics (e.g. upon resize) convert to local (pixel) coords.

* * *

[x] support for different numbers of films in movie selector (nice grid fills)
[x] support for different resolutions in movie selector

* * *

* * *

future improvements:

* * *

[x] gain slider in GUI
[x] gain field in the sample object
[x] connect the two and use gain field when mixing
[x] non-destructive normalisation: second (invisible) gain field
[x] save gains
[x] load gains if present

How to deal with sounds that are soft or loud?
1. find the normGain
2. make the gain = 1.0 / normGain

this way we can make the sound the loudest, but it starts out the same as recorded... something like that.

* * *

[x] when changing story board should change the curve as well
* * *

so, fix the curve editor...

[x] save the node height in the event marker
[x] save it with the event marker
[x] initialize node heights
[x] when editing the curve, should update the corresponding marker
[x] when adding a marker should update the curve properly
    now node blocks disappear
[x] make curve editor scrolling...


* * *

[ ] re-factor: all time lines partially share drag and drop. generalize.
[ ] re-factor: BufferAt should have methods for getting at SoundBuffer's range (including setter)
[ ] uv meter
[ ] optionally: mute when recording
[ ] movie import (transcode and cache the result)

* * *

today working on volume meter.

the best place seems next to the film (right and left of) - there is almost always some black there.
